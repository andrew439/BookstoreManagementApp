# BookstoreManagementApp
The Bookstore Managment App is a web based application created as the final project for the class .NET 3 at
Kirkwood Community College. The project was designed to demonstrate the skills learned in C#, object-oriented
programming, n-tier architecture, MVC, and T-SQL.

The app is for managing a bookstore and has a customer facing portion and an admin portion. On the the customer
side a user can create an account, view inventory, add books to a shopping cart, and enter shipping information.
On the admin side the user is able to view users and customers, assign or unassign roles, and add or remove books
from inventory.
